- writing a csv file
- reading a xml file
- writing a xml file
- reading a json file
- writing a json file
- reading a pickle file
- writing a pickle file
- reading a parquet file

# exercise

- calculate a summary
- write the files as a single json file
- later we might look into extracting data from pdf files!
