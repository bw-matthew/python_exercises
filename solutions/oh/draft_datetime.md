dates and times
====

# introduction
date and time manipulation and arithmetic is very important and can get quite complicated. typical units of time intervals have irregular relationship with other units (e.g. there are 365.2425 days in a year, there are 28 to 31 days per month and 51-53 weeks in the year). dates are formatted differently depending on the region, the first weekday of each week varies by convention, and then there are time zones to take into account.

thus it is quite common that we will need to compute with dates, either to switch date formats, or switch to a time interval unit that is more convenient for the task at hand. there are many famous examples of smart people getting datetime conversions wrong with serious consequences.

# get current datetime
- default formats
- time intervals
- unix epoch

# read dates, convert formats
- common formats
- convert between formats
- iso date format


# extract units
- year
- quarter
- month
- ISO week
