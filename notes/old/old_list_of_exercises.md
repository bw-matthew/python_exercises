old list. not realised.

## first things first
- get up and running
  + python 3.x
  + anaconda/jupyter/spyder
  + git
- `dir()`
- lambda functions
- `map()`, `filter`
- `[]` lists, list iterator, appending, copy, counting
- `()` itereator
- `.next()`
- list comprehension
- writing functions
- pyperclip.copy()/pyperclip.paste()?

## 01 access the file system
- first exercise. useful commands for traversing the file system structure
- `os.path.exists`
- `os.path.isfile`
- `os.path.isdir`
### Exercise
- create a new function
- traverses a directory tree
- collects file of a certain type and orders them by a metric

## 02 read and write data
- useful commands for reading csv, json, pickle, 
- writing 
- `with open`
- `pandas.read_csv`
- working with JSON
  + read
  + explore
  + write
- read and write pickle files 
  + import pickle
  + pickle.dump() (repeatedly)
  + pickle 'pointer chains'
  + pickle.load() (repeatedly)


### Exercise
- read a csv file
- read a json file
- read a pickle file
- get a summary of the contents
- write data to json
- look into the file to make sure that the contents are as expected

## 02 data manipulation (pipelines)
- dictionaries
- pandas data frames
- read in from file (pickle)
- filter out rows
- select some columns
- mutate column
- add column
- group by + summarise
- join two dataframes
- anti join to remove rows

### Exercise
- read two pickled data files
- get a set of repeated row identifiers
- get a set of 

## 04 text cleaning exercise
based on examples from [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=split#str.split)

- change case
- split text
- tokenise
- find elements
- regular expression (huge topic)
- import re; re.sub(r"[ ]+", ' ', 'this    sentence           has                non-uniform      spaces')
- convert to ubbidubbi
- regular expressions
- The isX String Methods
- `isalpha()`   returns True if the string consists only of letters and is not blank.
- `isalnum()`   returns True if the string consists only of letters and numbers and is not blank.
- `isdecimal()` returns True if the string consists only of numeric characters and is not blank.
- `isspace()`   returns True if the string consists only of spaces, tabs, and new-lines and is not blank.
- `istitle()`   returns True if the string consists only of words that begin with an uppercase letter followed by only lowercase letters.
- `startswith()`
- `endswith()`
- `split()`
- `join()`
- `rjust()`
- `ljust()`
- `center()`
- `'-'.join('There can be only one.'.split())`

- `copy()` (import pyperclip)
- `paste()`
-
