Special notice regarding risks,Factor Certificates are exposed to – possibly substantial – price fluctuations and involve the risk of considerable
"","losses. In unfavourable circumstances, despite the threshold provided for in the Factor Certificate and the"
"","underlying (Factor Index), a loss (including intra-day) may arise that is very close in financial terms to a total"
"",loss of the capital invested (including any costs arising in connection with the purchase of a Factor Certificate).
"",The investor must also be aware that possible price losses can also arise in the event of a sideways movement
"",(price alternately rises and falls) by the reference security.
"","Prior to investing in Factor Certificates, investors are advised to read all risk information (including ""Significant"
"","risks for investors"" below) and seek expert advice on the risks associated with the specific product."

Amount payable,"The amount payable corresponds, taking into account the ratio, to the reference price of the underlying"
"","(Factor Index) on the relevant valuation date, where applicable converted into the reference currency (at its"
"","own discretion, the Calculation Agent determines the exchange rate on the valuation date at the time of"
"",determining the reference price).
"",Payment is made 5 (five) banking days after the valuation date.

Issuer's right to call,The issuer has the right to terminate all outstanding Factor Certificates for early redemption on a termination
"","date (""termination date""; for the first time in March 2014) without stating a reason. The termination date is in"
"","each case the last banking day of every month of the year. The corresponding notice must be published, citing"
"","the termination date, at least 5 (five) banking days prior to the corresponding termination date on which the"
"","termination is effective. In this event, the term of the Factor Certificates ends prematurely."
"","In the event of termination, the amount payable is determined on the valuation date. The corresponding"
"",payment to the investor is made [5 (five)] banking days after the valuation date. All rights under the terminated
"",Factor Certificates expire upon payment of the amount payable.
Exercise rights of the investor,Besides the possibility of selling Factor Certificates on an off or on-exchange basis within the respective trading
"","hours, the investor has the right, subject to prior termination by the issuer, to exercise his Factor Certificates in"

"",exercising (i.e. name and address of holder; exercise declaration; precise description [including ISIN] and number
"",of book-entry securities that are to be exercised; settlement instructions for the bank managing the account).
"","The exercise declaration is binding and irrevocable once it is received by the Paying, Exercise and Calculation"
"",Agent. Exercise declarations received late or whose contents are incorrect are in principle invalid and not treated
"",as an exercise declaration with regard to subsequent exercise dates.
"","In the event of exercising, the amount payable is determined on the valuation date. The corresponding payment"
"",to the investor is made 5 (five) banking days after the valuation date. All investor rights under the exercised

Concept (Factor Index),A Factor,Index,tracks,the,percentage,change,of,a,reference,security,while,taking,into,account,the
"",corresponding leverage (factor) (see 'Description of the underlying (Factor Index)' below) on a daily basis. At,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"","the same time, the leverage effect remains constant. The basis for calculating the index level is the change in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"",the reference security versus the reference security's closing price on the previous day. With each closing price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"","of the underlying, therefore, a new reference price is determined that in turn represents the basis for the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"",following day's percentage performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"","Due to the leverage effect, Factor Indices may result in overproportional price losses; a total loss or even a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"",negative index level is avoided as far as possible owing to the respective threshold (i.e. the maximum permitted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"",change in the price of the reference security since the latest adjustment prior to an intra-day adjustment in the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"",Factor Index; see 'Description of underlying (Factor Index)' below). In the event of excessive price losses for the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"",Factor Index (depending on the structure of the respective Factor Index and specific level of the threshold; for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"","details, see 'Description of the underlying (Factor Index)' below), the calculation of the Factor Index is halted",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"",and a new,day,is simulated.,,Depending,on the,performance,,of,a reference,,"security,",several,intra-day,
