    "- fiscal years differ from calendar years (and are location specific!).\n",
    "- we might need to count events during a time period in number of working days (excluding weekends and holidays from the count). \n",
    "- given a datestamp, consider how you can find out what week number does that time stamp take place in? to calculate this from first principles we'd need to to know \n",

    "    + what timezone was the timestamp recorded and in which timezone are we counting the weeks? (imagine we are aggregating by week as observed in UTC and the time stamp above was recorded in china standard time, many hours ahead. then the timestamp may actually belong to the \"next week\".)\n",

    "luckily python has modules that help with these formats and calculations. we just need to learn to use them. here we will demonstrate the use of the `datetime` module. there are two aspects at play here. the first is date and time formating, and the second is date and time arithmetic. the latter is impossible without the former. \n",

    "### a plea:\n",
    "please, please, please, from now on, whenever and whereever you need to display a date, no matter what the context is, use the [iso format designed to minimize misunderstanding and confusion](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html): *YYYY-MM-DD*. \n",

    "this is the internationally recognized date format and therefore the best format, bar none, whose adoption will reduce confusion and errors. use it. design dates fields in forms this way. date your notes this way. set your computer's localisation format to this. expect dates in this format by default. shame those who won't, for their only defense is bigotry favouring their own familiarity which hides a callous indifference to the unforeseeable errors caused by date confusion.\n",
