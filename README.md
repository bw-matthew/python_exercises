starting to write easy python exercises for internal use.

# introduction
the data science team generally uses python for all its work. the team members have very varied experience and needs with working in python. nevertheless, we all want to improve something. these exercises are meant to present some useful features of python to inepxerienced users. it may not suit absolute beginners without slight modifications. we assume participants have python 3.7+ installed and ready to use, as well as their favourite text editor. our code will not be backwards compatible with python 2.x.

## notes on git
this course does not cover how to use git, but assumes the participants can. matthew franglen (@matthew) wrote a nice short [workshop on git](https://gitlab.com/matthewfranglen/version-control-presentation/tree/master) that might be helpful. 

# exercises
the design goal of each of the exercises is that they can be discussed with participants in a 30 minute session and then the participants get a task (homework) to test their understanding of the feature.


## jupyter notebooks
- installation
- launching
- using (modes, keyboard shortcuts, starting and stopping executions, error handling)
- comparison with using the command line interface
- viewing/saving/updating notebook documents

## python style guide
- do we need this?
- details, details
- bw may not have style guide?

## the various iterators
- `map()`, `filter`
- `[]` list iterator
- lambda functions
- `()` itereator
- `next()`

## numerical computation
- numpy
- numerical precision
- format numbers for presentation/ rounding. 
- matrices, linear algebra, 

## dates and times
- date time objects
- convert date formats
- extract century, year, quarter, month, weekday, day, hour
- datetime arihmetic
- time zones? (gah!)

## read and write csv
- `os.path.exists`
- `os.path.isfile`
- `os.path.isdir`
- `with open`
- `pandas.read_csv`

## working with JSON
- read
- explore
- write

## data manipulation (pipelines)
- pandas data frames
- filter
- select
- mutate
- group by
- summarise

## text cleaning exercise
- change case
- split text
- tokenise
- find elements

## simple plots
- ? (do not know much about plotting with python)
- need to look into matplotlib
- need to look into plotly
- need to look into dash

## spacy/nltk


# solutions
participants in the tutorial can add their solutions/musings/code into a self-named sub-folder in the `solutions` folder.

# notes
a list of documents and links to other documents explaining features discussed in greater detail.
